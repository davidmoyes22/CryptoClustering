# CryptoClustering
In this Challenge, youâ€™ll apply your understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, you will examine price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.
# Code Considerations
I referenced files from class while writing the code for my homework assignment. I also used the Xpert Learning Assistant for clarification on what this prompt means: "# Create a scatter plot using hvPlot by setting x=PCA1 and y=PCA2".
